The middle button moves the current camera:
	- dragging the mouse while holding no key changes rotation TODO: around the selected object if any
	TODO: - dragging the mouse while holding Alt changes the translation perpendicularly to the camera axis
	TODO: - dragging the mouse while holding Ctrl changes the translation in parallelly to the ground (think that you grab the
	ground, like in black & white)
